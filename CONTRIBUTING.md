## Contributor License Agreement

Contributors are required to execute a contributor license agreement before
their contributions can be accepted. The ICLA (individual contributor license
agreement) can be found [here](ICLA.txt).


## Unit tests

The unit tests in tests/ should be run before submitting a PR, and new
tests should be written for new function.
